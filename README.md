Photo Frame Server:

This is a flask server used to upload and delete photos from a SQL database being saved on a Raspberry Pi which is then used to display a picture on a monitor.

So far the server has a POST Create_photo, GET Random_photo and a DELETE Delete_photo route to allow for manipulation of the database.
